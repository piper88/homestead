        <h2>Adventures in Homesteading</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the offical website of our soon-to-be homestead! My name is Sarah and boyfriend's name is Nick, and together we are working towards our dream of living off the land and avoiding the rat race of the typical 9-5 life. I'm an aspiring web developer, hoping to eventually gain enough coding knowledge to be able to be a freelance web developer. We are still in the early stages of our dream, but we wanted to share our experiences and eventually our newfound knowledge with the world in the hopes of perhaps inspiring others to consider an alternative lifestyle. </p>
